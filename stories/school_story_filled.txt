Dear school nurse: miss Debby

Brendan blue jeans will not be attending school today he has come down with a case of the hippy and has a horrible growth and a raging fever. We have made an appointment with the funny doctor who, who has studied for 10 years and has 2 degrees in pediatrics. He will send you all the chocolate drugs you need.

Sincerely,
Mrs. deboozie
